# Multiplication Table Program

This simple Java program prints a multiplication table from **1 × 1** to **n × n**.

## Features

- Takes input from user (1 to 10).
- If input is not between 1 and 10, shows an error and stops.
- Uses **nested for loops** to create the table.
- Uses `System.out.printf()` to align the output.
