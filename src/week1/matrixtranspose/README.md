# Matrix Transpose
### How cod is working :
* The matrix is defined using the data received from the user.
* Then row and column changes are applied to find the transpose.
* It is written to the screen in matrix format.
## Main process :
```java
for (int i = 0; i < collum; i++) {    
            for (int j = 0; j <row; j++) {
                arrayTranspose[i][j] = inputArray[j][i];
            }
        }
```
